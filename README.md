# Flask Moscow Time Web Application

This is a simple web application built with Flask that displays the current time in Moscow. keeps track of the number of times the root endpoint (`/`) has been accessed. The visit count is persisted in a file named `visits.txt`.

### Features

- **Root Endpoint (`/`)**: Displays the current time in Moscow and the number of visits.
- **Visits Endpoint (`/visits`)**: Displays the total number of visits.

## Getting Started

1. Install the required dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:
   ```shell
   python app_python.py
   ```

3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to see the current time in Moscow.

## Docker

To build the Docker image locally, run the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
docker build -t image_name .
```

### Pull

```bash
docker arinazaza/app_python.py 
```

### Run

To run the Docker container from the built or pulled image, execute the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name container_name -p 8000:8000 image_name
```

This command will start a container with the name `container_name`, bind the container's port 8000 to the host's port 8000, and use the `image_name` image.

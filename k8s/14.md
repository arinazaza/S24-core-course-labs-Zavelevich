## Kubernetes Cluster Monitoring with Prometheus

### Explanation of Kube Prometheus Stack Components

**1. The Prometheus Operator**

The Prometheus Operator - manager for Prometheus in a Kubernetes cluster. It automates the creation, configuration, and management of Prometheus instances. It simplifies the process of setting up and maintaining Prometheus

**2. Highly Available Prometheus**

Highly Available Prometheus collects and stores metrics from different targets in the Kubernetes cluster. It provides redundancy and reliability, so a monitoring system can handle failures without downtime.

**3. Highly Available Alertmanager**

The Alertmanager is responsible for handling alerts sent by Prometheus. It can deduplicate alerts, group them, and route them to the correct receiver. It ensures that alerts are not lost during an outage.

**4. Prometheus node-exporter**

The node-exporter is a small agent that runs on each node. It collects metrics about the node's hardware and operating system, such as CPU usage, memory usage etc.

**5. Prometheus blackbox-exporter**

The blackbox-exporter is used to probe endpoints. It helps you monitor the availability and performance of services from the outside, simulating how external users might experience services.

**6. Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs**

Prometheus Adapter for Kubernetes Metrics APIs collects metrics from Kubernetes and makes it availabe for Prometheus. It enables to use Prometheus metrics for autoscaling and other Kubernetes features, making a cluster more dynamic.

**7. kube-state-metrics**

kube-state-metrics is an agent that listens to the Kubernetes API server and generates metrics about the state of Kubernetes objects, such as pods, deployments, services, and nodes. It gives a detailed view of the state of a cluster.

**8. Grafana**

Grafana is a visualization tool that allows to create dashboards and graphs from Prometheus metrics. It provides a user-friendly interface for analyzing monitoring data.
